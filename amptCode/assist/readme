4/2015 test version v1.26t5/v2.26t5:
     * Random seed for HIJING is modified in main.f, so that a different 
       random seed will always lead to a different random number sequence 
       (in earlier versions, an even integer leads to the same random number 
       sequence as the odd integer that is bigger than it by 1).
     * set upper limit for gamma_s=P(s)/P(u) to 0.4 (to limit strangeness 
       enhancement when string tension is strongly increased due to 
       a very low value of parameter b in Lund symmetric splitting function
       as done in arXiv:1403.6321).
